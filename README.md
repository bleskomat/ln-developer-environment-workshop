We will go throw different ways to setup a development environment for developing on top on lightning network and have some practical examples

## What we want to achieve

- research on the options in the ecosystem
- what has projects been doing
- what are projects doing now
- What are the problems (ln on testnet not reliable, no good tooling)

  - to be used in development
  - it does what you expect
  - it is easy to share across developers
  - it is reproducible
  - to be used in CI and tests
- create an example using a simple LSP server
